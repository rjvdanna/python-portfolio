My Python programs
# Project Title

## Problem
The problem I was attempting to solve was fixing variables. This matters because Thonny needs clear consistent variables in a spreadsheet in order to run.

## Solution
My project is simple, running a code from a spreadsheet to organize data.

## Tools
Language was python and the data sets are from google spreadsheets.

## Results
It was accurate after resolving the flaws in a few variables that prevented the code from working.

## Learning
One important thing I learned from this project is to have clear consistent variables and to avoid making errors such as mixing data, numbers not written in letters and # at once.
